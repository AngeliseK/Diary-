Week 1 & Week 2

=begin Week1: 

- Focused on navigating the command line
    - Creating files
    - Listing hidden files
    - Navigating through directories 
- Focused on Git Version Control 
    - Setting up Git 
    - Initialising Git 
    - Commiting files 

- This part of the module was quite simple - I enjoyed learning about Git and how essential it is to software engineers. 
- Committing files etc - also helped me with the ruby foundation challenges after 

Week2:
- Focused on Learning the foundations of Ruby 
    - Stings
    - Arguments 
    - Conditionals
    - Methods 
    - Arrays 
    - Classes 
    - Hashes 
    - Object Instantiation 

- I found this part more challengeing, especially Chapter 2 and Chapter 3. 
- The drills were very useful, and it was really fun going through them, and using the rspec. 
- The chapter 2 programming, took me longer than I would have liked - I think object instantiation and fully understanding the relationship between classes/methods - is something I need to focus on.
