WEEK 3: 
Focused on 
    - Testing methods and classes 
    - Testing for errors 
    - Designing classes and then tested them 

- This first part of the module I struggled with - However I realised the importance of diagrams.\
- I began to draw using excali draw my classes - so that I understood the relationship between the multi-class-systems 
- Also, creating my own tests allowed me to understand classes and methods more 
- I went back to ruby foundations and did the RSPEC for some of the drills (so that I could practise more)
- I think I need to focus on the multi-class-system part more, so that I am more 
    familiar and confident with different ruby functions and writing code to get the output I want - this is definitely an area I want to improve on 
- I received good feedback from my coach Will on one of the challenges - I followed 
    the TDD process well 


WEEK 4:
Focused on:
    - Unit Tests 
    - Peer class testing 
    - Doubles 
    - API 
    - Terminal IO 
    - Solo Project 

- This week was more easier for me. I think it's because I switched up my learning style. 
- I found the doubles, unit testing, terminal IO quite easy to follow and understand 
- I particularly enjoyed the solo project - I think unit testing and doubles allowed me to understand 
    multi-class-systems better. 


Need To Work On:
- Week 3's content - in particular the Multi-class-system challenge
